abstract: "Today's cars have a complex in-vehicle network and millions lines of
code that control almost every function in the vehicle, including the safety
critical functions. The in-vehicle networks are vulnerable and security threats
against them have proved to affect the safety of passengers. To counter these
vulnerabilities, different security solutions have been proposed.  In this
short paper, we study two recently proposed anomaly-based Intrusion Detection
Systems (IDS) that adopt deep neural network and ECU fingerprinting for attack
detection."
