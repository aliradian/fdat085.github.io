abstract: "Data analysts mine large databases and crunch data in order to
  extrapolate statistics and interesting patterns.
  However people's privacy is jeopardized in the process, whenever a
  database contains private data.
  *Differential privacy* has emerged recently as an appealing
  rigourous definition of privacy, which protects individuals in a
  database, while allowing data analysts to learn facts about the
  underling population, by adding noise to queries.
  Unfortunately, proving differential privacy of programs is a
  difficult and error-prone task.
  In this paper, we survey the state-of-the-art applications of
  programming languages techniques to develop principled approaches
  and tool support to ease the analysis and verification of
  probabilistic differential private programs."
