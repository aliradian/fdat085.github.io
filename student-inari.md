abstract: "The way you write text—essays, emails, tweets, even source code—reveals a lot about you, even if you have taken other means to ensure anonymity or pseudonymity. In this talk, we introduce the problem of authorship attribution: how does it work, what can be identified, and if, or how, it can be circumvented. "
