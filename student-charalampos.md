abstract: "GPUs have become popular computing platforms for a wide spectrum of applications, offering  promising acceleration capabilities through unique hardware features. In the realm of security, GPUs have had dual use: both as means to increase systems security and as a source of vulnerabilities to compromise systems. We summarise two recent results in the field: PixelVault, a system that uses a GPU to protect cryptographic keys, as well as work that exploits GPU vulnerabilities to inspect user's data."
